function FeedbackBoardError(): React.JSX.Element {

    <div>
      <h1>Feedback Board Page error</h1>
      <p>Something went wrong with Feedback Board Page.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        TO DO: Think what should happen if Feedback Board Page cannot be
        rendered. Does the user gets redirected to Login Page, or a default
        Feedback Board Layout is displayed along with a "Retry" button?
      </p>
    </div>

export default FeedbackBoardError;
